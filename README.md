Team Members:
* Cameron Farquhar
* Hector Rivas
* Chase Webb

Project Description/Outline
What makes a team successful? Is it population? Is it the average income of the area? This project is to find out exactly that and how it impacts the teams. From attendance to revenue, we will delve into this world of sports with a focus on NBA, MLB, NHL, NFL, and MLS.

Research Questions to Answer
Are major league teams more successful when they come from more densely populated areas?
Are major league teams more successful when they come from areas with higher average income?
Does this trend affect one sport more than the others?
How many wins do the cities have?
